From what I understand, Donna Haraway published <i>The Cyborg Manifesto</i> at a time when academia was debating identity politics, particularly within feminist/intellectual circles. 
 Where theorists were considering intersectionality, Haraway came to an opposing conclusion, one that stirred a lot of thoughts (but in recent years has been somewhat discredited, including by Haraway herself).
</p>
<p>
What follows is a summary of my understanding.
</p>
<p>
The Cyborg Manifesto rejects the binary oppositions that dominate our lives. Specifically, the manifesto discusses the modern binaries of:
<ul><li>
human/animal
<li>animal-human/machine</li>
<li>physical/non-physical</li>
</ul>
These binaries are produced and constructed in a Western (read: patriarchal, heteronormative, capitalist, etc) point-of-view.
</p>
<p>
Here's where cyborg theory comes into it.
</p>
<p> Cybernetics is the study of systems of control, in this case, anthropological control. You can consider capitalism, patriarchy, family systems, and more as a cybernetic system.
    In these cybernetic systems, you have cyborgs, the subjects of the system and controls.
