            <p>
                I see it far too often -- on the internet, many rich text editors use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>
                and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> in place of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> by default.
                What many don't realise is that when it comes to semantic HTML, these aren't intended to be interchangeable and actually have different semantic
                meaning.

            </p><p>Let's go through each one.</p>
<!--
            <div role="summary" class="summary">
            <p role="summary">

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> are <b>semantic</b> tags - they mark a semantic difference in words.
                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> are <b>presentational</b> tags - they make text look bold and italic. This
                    is so they're visually marked apart from other text, either for utilitarian purposes or to indicate
                    some different form or quality of text</li>
                <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> marks text as having strong importance, and looks visually bold
                    <div role="example" class="example">
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This area is dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;Avoid travelling through this area.&lt;/strong&gt;</code>

                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> marks text with stress emphasis, and looks visually italic
                    <div role="example" class="example"><code>This is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; one.</code>
                </li>
                </div>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul></div>
-->
            <h2>&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;</h2>
            <p>I think of <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> as <b>semantic</b> tags. When they're
                applied to some text, they add semantic meaning to the text.</p>
            <p>By default, text in a strong tag is bolded, and text in an em tag is italicised. Keep in mind, however
                that this can be changed with CSS.</p>


            <h3>Using &lt;strong&gt; tags</h3>

            <p>According to the HTML spec, the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-strong-element.html">
                represents strong importance for its contents.
            </blockquote>
            <p>When you apply <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> to words, you're saying that those words are serious, important,
            or urgent in some way.</p>

            <p>The most common use would be to mark something as a warning, or important.</p>
            <div role="example" class="example">
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This area is dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;Avoid travelling through this area.&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
            </div>

            <div role="example" class="example">
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;Check your answers before submitting your details.&lt;/strong&gt;</code></div>
            <p>This means the only time you use it is to mark something as semantically important.</p>
            <p>The HTML spec actually goes on to say:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-strong-element.html">The relative level of importance of a piece of content is given by its number of ancestor strong
                elements; each strong element increases the importance of its contents.</blockquote>


            <p>This means that nested <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags actually increase the level of importance.</p>


            <h3>Using &lt;em&gt; tags</h3>

            <p>According to the HTML spec, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-em-element.html">represents stress emphasis of its contents.</blockquote>
            <p>When you apply <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to words, you're adding stress emphasis to those words, changing
                the meaning of the text. Have a look at the following example:</p>
            <div role="example" class="example">
                This is your one.
            </div>

            <p>The meaning of this sentence will change depending on which words are stressed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>This</em> is your one - This one (as opposed to the other one) is yours</li>
                <li>This <em>is</em> your one - I'm certain that this particular one is indeed yours</li>
                <li>This is <em>your</em> one - This one (out of others) is yours in particular</li>
                <li>This is your <em>one</em> - You only get one of these, and this is your one of these</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this case, you'd use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to mark this specific stress emphasis. While
                <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> marks these words visually, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> marks it semantically in the
                HTML. This means that <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is actually a integral part of the content as it alone
                explains this stress meaning. If for whatever reason the CSS stylesheet isn't working and therefore not
                showing italics, the underlying HTML would still have the correct stress emphasis.</p>

            <p>Similar to <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, the HTML spec says:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-em-element.html">
                The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor em
                elements.
            </blockquote>
            <p>This means that you can express different levels of stress, depending on the number of
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> ancestor tags there are. For example:</p>
            <div role="example" class="example">
                <code>&lt;em&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your one!&lt;/em&gt;</code>
            </div>
            <p>
                This sentence shows the speaker is certain this one is yours, and is emphatically fighting to have that
                position heard.</p>

            <h2>&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;</h2>

            <p>I think of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> as presentational tags. When applied, text
                is visually marked apart from other text, either for utilitarian purposes or to indicate some different
                form or quality of text.</p>
               
            <h3>Using &lt;b&gt; tags</h3>

            <p>According to the HTML spec, the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-b-element.html"> represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without
                conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words
                in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software,
                or an article lede. </blockquote>
            <p>Put simply, you use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> to make text look bold so that it's easier to use. For
                example, you could make key words bold so they're easier to identify.</p>
            <p>Note that this bolded text doesn't indicate alternate voice or mood, and it doesn't impart any additional meaning. 
           </p>


            <h3>Using &lt;i&gt; tags</h3>
            <p>According to the HTML spec, the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-i-element.html">
                represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a
                manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an
                idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag has a lot going on, but the main purpose is to show that something is being
            said in a different voice, mood, or manner.</p>
            <p>You could use it to show that some text is a thought or some
            other manner of speaking.</p>
            <div role="example" class="example">
                <code>&lt;i&gt;I hope this doesn't go badly&lt;/i&gt;, Ada prayed.</code>
            </div>
            <p>You'd also use it to mark phrases in another language, technical terms, taxonomic designations, and very
                uniquely, for the name of ships in Western texts.</p>
            <div role="example" class="example">
                <code>"I'll see you later, &lt;i lang="fr"&gt;ma cherie&lt;/i&gt;," promised Wilson. Wilson quickly boarded &lt;i&gt;The Washington&lt;/i&gt;.  The future of &lt;i class="taxonomy"&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; was relying on their work being successful. </code>
            </div>

            <p>Note that you should be using the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag rather than <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> if
                you're defining a term for the first time. For more information, see <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-dfn-element.html#the-dfn-element"
                    target="_blank">The dfn element - HTML5: Edition for Web Authors</a>.</p>
         
         
         
                    <h2>Effect on web accessiblilty</h2>
            <p>My understanding is that most major screen readers don't actually signify the semantics of these tags.
            </p>
            <p>Why? We might find an answer in the NVDA screen reader, which signified it for a brief time. It was
                reported as being extremely unpopular among users and resulted in a lot of complaints. They remarked
                that <b>emphasis was over-used in the wild</b>.</p>
            <p>When every rich text editor uses <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> as bold and italics as default, it's no wonder it's overused.</p>
       
            <h2>What next?</h2>
            <p>It's a huge shame that these tags have been misused. There's an opportunity to create richer text and
                richer meaning, but misuse has ironically made the web less accessible.</p>
           
           
                <p>This problem highlights a larger issue: 
                    Everyone can easily write online, but few know online writing conventions. So how can we ensure
                    that the average person writing for the web is writing semantically?</p>
    
           
                <p>How do we solve an issue like this? I'm not sure. If all web users and rich text editors were to tag
                everything correctly from this point forward, we'd still have a slew of existing content to fix.</p>
            <p>Maybe in future we could use AI as a solution:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>GPTs could check and fix misused tags</b> - this doesn't solve the issue of rich text editors misusing
                    the tags and creating even more un-semantic content.</li>
                <li><b>We could create AI screen readers</b> - rather than relying on semantic HTML to read out a page, it
                    could visually parse a page's text and meaning, without accessing semantic tagging at all. It would
                    then rely on visual and textual clues to discern and signify meaning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's all conjecture. I don't know what the future holds or how the semantic web might change. This is
                what we have currently, and until it changes I'll continue to tag things as correctly as I can -- we owe
                it to everyone to make the web as accessible as possible.</p>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can this be solved? Should this be solved?</li>
                <li>Do you use a screen reader? How does a lack of semantic signification affect how you experience the
                    web?</li>
