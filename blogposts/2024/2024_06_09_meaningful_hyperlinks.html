        <h1>Meaningful hyperlinks</h1>
        <time date="2024-06-09">6 June, 2024</time>

        <p>Well-written links are important. I remember receiving an email at work from the CEO about new business templates. I scanned through to find the hyperlink/underlined words that would take me to
            the new signature template.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, each link in the post looked like this:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2rem;"><a href="#">here</a></p>

        <p>I wasn't in a hurry and it wasn't particularly long, but it annoyed me to have to slow down and read each
            line for context of which link I actually wanted to open.</p>
        <p>Imagine how this would change if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>you were serving customers in a busy workplace,</li>
            <li>you were short on time, with people demanding your attention,</li>
            <li>you were searching a page for one specific link and that page was several paragraphs long, with 15 links
                each saying "here", "learn more", or "more information".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's a lot of ways to make our links better. I'll only focus on a couple here.</p>
        <h2>Use meaningful link text</h2>
        <p>In the example above, the links told us nothing about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the link's content</li>
            <li>where it would take us if we clicked it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This adds cognitive load because we have to stop and assess whether these links are relevant. We can make
            our links better by anchoring them to meaningful text.

        </p>

        <h3>
            Why use meaningful link text
        </h3>


        <ul>
            <li><b>It improves usability:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        it removes ambiguity about where a link might lead, providing a clear information scent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it makes it easier to decide whether someone should click a link, reducing cognitive load
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it helps to differentiate links from one another
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>It makes links accessible:</b> A screen reader user will skim through content by jumping between
                headings and links. All the links in the example above would be read out as "Link: here", which is
                unhelpful.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>It aids SEO:</b> Meaningful, descriptive links help search engines understand what's contained in a
                linked page and provide better search results.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>It aids scanning:</b> When scanning a webpage, your eyes are naturally drawn to headings and links,
                which act like signposts to determine what a page is about and where to go next.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Writing good, meaningful link text</h2>
        <p>There's a few things you can do to write better link text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Give enough information:</b> Make sure the link text tells us enough to figure out what it is and
                where the link will take us, without needing to read the surrounding words for context. Essentially,
                could you determine your link's purpose or destination when viewed out of context (for many, that's how
                they'll first see it).
                <br />Something I've observed is that meaningful links tend to either be the name of the page/document
                being linked to, or will otherwise include some kind of noun phrase/topic.
            </li>
            <li><b>Match the destination content when possible:</b> If you click a link that says, "Create a ticket" but
                it takes you to a page saying "Submit a request", that can be confusing and leave people wondering if it
                took them to the correct page.</li>


        </ul>

        <h2>Avoid mid-sentence links</h2>
        <p>There's evidence that shows mid-sentence links can slow people's reading. </p>
        <p> Slowing people's reading may be useful in some cases (for example, if you want people to read something
            carefully), but generally you want to make reading and comprehension easy.
        </p>

        <h3>Why avoid mid-sentence links?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>It reduces cognitive load:</b>
                Users will evaluate links to determine whether to click them or not. When a link appears in the middle
                of a sentence, they also have to evaluate whether to keep reading the rest of the sentence or not. The
                cognitive load is greater when there are several links in a sentence.

            </li>
            <li><b>It pushes users to navigate away:</b>
                Mid-sentence links can cause users to navigate away from content, even before completing reading a
                sentence.
            </li>
            <li><b>It makes scanning tricky:</b>
                Users are shown to stop and read text on both sides of an mid-sentence link.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Avoiding mid-sentence links</h3>
        <p> It's considered good practice to place links at the end of sentences, as they conclude the sentence with a
            natural exit point.
        </p>

        <h2>Remaining questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is it an issue to repeat the same link more than once in a single piece of content?</li>
            <li>Do links feel better when you open them in a new tab?</li>
            <li>Are anchor links at the start of an article inherently good or evil?</li>
        </ul>
