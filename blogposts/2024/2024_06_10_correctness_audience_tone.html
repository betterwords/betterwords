            <h1>Correctness, audience, and tone</h1>
            <time date="2024-06-10">10 June, 2024</time>

            <p>
                At university, I had an English lecturer who would always say: <q>"Why would you ever use a semicolon?
                    Nobody knows how they work."</q>
            </p>

            <h2>Correctness</h2>

            <p>
                When it comes to writing and language, we learn to apply language rules "correctly". But not all of
                these correctness rules are real (bear with me). For example:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Real grammar rule: Articles precede nouns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Style rule: Don't end sentences with a preposition.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A grammar rule like <i>Articles precede nouns</i> has real, grammatical authority. You can say <i>"Where's the
                dog"</i>, but you can't say <i>"Where's dog the"</i>, because the sentence would appear incoherent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Style rules are different. In everyday speech, it's completely fine and valid to end a sentence with a
                preposition, as with:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Who did you give the cake to?
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                But the style rule above would probably have you say:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                To whom did you give the cake?
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This may be 'correct', but to my ears, it sounds...stilted.
            </p>
            <p>
                These kinds of style rules have likely arisen to address real grammar issues. For example, <i>Don't
                    begin
                    sentences with a contraction</i> probably came about to avoid sentence fragments like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The plan was rejected. Because it was incomplete.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                More often now, these style rules are confused for grammar itself (in no small part thanks to strong adherence to Strunk and White).
            </p>

            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>
                When my English lecturer said nobody knows how semicolons work, he meant that people didn't know how to
                read them (but also that he was tired of his students using them incorrectly).

            </p>
            <p>
                When we're writing, we're writing for an audience. It might be correct to use a semicolon or some other
                construction, but if most people don't understand how to use or read a semicolon, aren't we just
                creating unnecessary stumbling blocks?
            </p>

            <p>
                In one of my technical writing jobs, I'd keep discovering grammar constructions designed to avoid
                putting a preposition at the end of a sentence:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                ...link this Voucher to the ticket type for which it will be redeemed.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I rarely hear people say "for which" in real life. At best, a sentence like this comes off as tonally
                over-formal and old-fashioned. At worst, it violates principles of plain English, using constructions
                your audience are unfamiliar with or might not easily understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we're aiming to communicate to our audience effectively, we should prefer to ignore a style rules
                like this.

            </p>
            <h2>
                Tone
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm not advocating that we throw all language rules out, just that it's important to be aware of the
                ways correctness rules can affect our writing. But even if we ignore issues of plain English, the <i>for
                    which</i> example demonstrates a sliding scale of formality and informality in tone:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An overly formal tone can appear stuffy or old-fashioned, which doesn't really suit a modern,
                    cutting-edge tech company.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An overly informal tone can appear amateurish, unserious, untrustworthy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If we're writing for a company, we can't be completely informal because there's nearly always going to
                be a level of formality we must maintain.

            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, we can't be formal and correct all the time for every situation. To me, that would be
                like wearing a tuxedo to the beach -- a tuxedo is always formal, but it's not always appropriate.
            </p>

            <p>Ultimately, decisions like this should put effective communications before correctness.</p>

            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I remember one of my linguistics lecturers being asked how we considered a word to be "real" or not. He
                said very simply: <q>"If you use a word and someone understands it, it's a word."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                I generally try to approach my writing this way. My primary concern is communicating effectively in a
                given situation or context. I still apply good writing principles and give enough detail to be
                understood. But ultimately, if the person I'm writing for can understand me, then I consider that
                effective communication.

            </p>


            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Should communication win out against grammar? Is there a level to which that's
                    acceptable/unacceptable?

                </li>
                <li>
                    What are some style rules that u h8?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Don't you dare</i> is considered acceptable English, but when expanded to <i>Do not you dare</i>,
                    it's considered incorrect. How would you rephrase this "correctly"? "Dare-you not"?

                </li>
                <li>
                    (Serious question) Do emojis have a place in writing? Where writing stands in for speech, I think
                    emojis may be able to provide tone that's missing
                </li>
                <li> Have you ever worn a tuxedo at the beach??
                </li>
            </ul>

                    This topic was inspired by a chapter in <a

                        Clarity and Grace</a> (thanks to my friend Brent for the recommendation). The whole book is
                    fantastic and dives into a lot of really interesting topics on writing with clarity.
